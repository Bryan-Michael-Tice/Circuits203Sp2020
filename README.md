Inverting Summing Amplifier Circuit

	UNM Circuits 203 
	Instructor: Dr. Elfrgani
	Team: Tice^2



Extra Credit Project Description

	This project was created by Bryan and Paul Tice. It is inspired from the problem 5.12 in the textbook,"Electric Circuits", written by Nilsson & Riedel, edition 11. The goal of the program is to complete the problem in the book, learn about how electrical engineering/computer engineering coexist and leave a functinal data structure to expand for other OP Amps in the future. This program uses dynamically allocation to create a structure of a inverting-summing op amp.
